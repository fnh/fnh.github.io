<h1>On the risks of quick fixes</h1>
<p>
Every software system has its issues. Usually, at any point in time, there are many 
ideas for new features, enhancements, as well as fixes waiting to be implemented. 

A lot of them are indeed solvable with a few lines. But many of those small tasks 
are wasted work because they work around a problem, which could and actually <i>should</i> 
be solved by a slightly larger change, that requires some - but not very much - more effort. 
</p>
<p>
If the order of development is optimizing for throughput, the so-called quick 
wins and quick fixes will be prioritized and the effect results in a well-known
problem in scheduling algorithms: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)">starvation</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Resource starvation is a problem encountered in concurrent computing where a process is 
perpetually denied necessary resources to process its work.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this case, the process is the task in the backlog, which would be the fundamental solution 
to the problem, and the resource is the allocation of time to work on that task.
</p>

<p>
Steve McConnell formulated yet another risk of those quick wins and fixes in his 
"Software Project Survival Guide" (p. 127):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The problem with quick and dirty, as some people have said, is that dirty remains 
long after quick has been forgotten.

<h1>The Second-System Effect - Excerpts</h1>

<p>
The following is an excerpt from chapter 5 of "The Mythical Man-Month" (1995 edition) by Fred Brooks. 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If one separates the responsibility for functional specification 
from responsibility for for building a fast, cheap product, what discipline
bounds the architect's inventive enthusiasm?
</p>
<p>
The fundamental answer is thoroughgoing, careful, and communication between 
architect and builder.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The architect has two possible answers when confronted with an estimate that is too high:
cut the design or challenge the estimate by suggesting cheaper implementations.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
For it to be successful, the architect must
<ul>
<li>remember that the builder has the inventive and creative responsibility for the implementation [..]</li>
<li>[..] be prepared to suggest <i>a</i> way of implementing anything he specifies [..]</li>
<li>deal quietly and privately in such suggestions</li>
<li>be ready to forgo credit for suggested improvements</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The builder will counter by suggesting changes to the architecture. Often [..] some minor
feature may have [..] large costs when the implementation is worked out.
</blockquote> 

<p>
Brooks considers that, the first system which an architect builds is potentially clean.
As the system is designed, there are ideas which get stored away to be used "next time".
All the frills and embellishments which were kept out of the first design, often make it into 
the next system. Therefore, he states:
</p>

<blockquote>The general tendency is to over-design the second system [..]</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>
<b>The second system ist the most dangerous system a man ever designs.</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
Basic system assumptions can change. These changes make some techniques obsolete. 
The tendency to refine those can be another symptom of the second-system effect.
</p>

<p>
An architect cannot skip designing a second system, but he can be conscious of it hazards. 
Self-discipline must be exercised to avoid functional ornamentation ("gold plating") 
and sinking time in obsolete areas and functions.

<h1>Two classes of disagreement</h1>
<p>
I learned about the concept of two classes of disagreement from an anecdote
in Michael Hiltzik's book <i>Dealers of Lightning</i> on the history of Xerox PARC.
</p>

<p>
He describes strong tensions between Robert Metcalfe and Chuck Thacker, 
who are both pioneers of the Ethernet and personal computing. Hiltzik quotes Bob Taylor, 
the manager of PARCs computer science lab, who introduces what he calls a 
"Class One disagreement" as the root cause.
</p>

<p>
According to Taylor, two people have a Class One disagreement when they disagree 
and neither can explain to the other's satisfaction the other's point of view.
When each person can explain to the other's satisfaction the other's point of view,
it's a Class Two disagreement. The latter enables people to work together, even if 
they disagree, while the former is destructive.
</p>

<p>
With that framework in mind, when you "agree to disagree", it would be 
wise to ensure that it is on a Class Two disagreement.

<h1>Can you ever know enough about people?</h1>

<p>
I recently finished <i>100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Susan Weinschenk has compiled a lot of research into a hundred short essays.
The book covers a lot of ground with topics ranging from perception, over
how human memory and thinking and decision making processes work to how
humans tend to deal with errors. 
</p>

<p>
The book doesn't require any prior knowledge. It is very digestible and actionable.
The chapters are to the point and contain a condensed list of key takeaways. 
No reading order is required. Being very broad in topics makes it rather hard to summarize -
yet cheapskates and people in a hurry could probably even get some insights 
out of simply reading once through the table of contents. 
</p>

<p>All in all: a recommended reading.</p>

<h1>It's been a while...</h1>

<p>
Many, many years ago, I maintained a website. It was fun. 
Then life got in the way, domains expired, and that site fell into oblivion. 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I made a profession out of what was once my hobby.

Earning one's bread doing what one would have gladly pursued free, for passion
is a privilege granted to only a fraction of the human race, as Fred Brooks 
rightfully stated in the epilogue of his seminal <i>Mythical Man-Month</i>.
So, by and large, I consider myself a very lucky man. 
</p>

<p>
Yet, over the years I lost track of the passion, the fun aspect slipped away a bit.
This, therefore, is an attempt at rekindling it. For now, in the shape of a single
file, filled with random musings of some <a href="https://rakhim.org/images/honestly-undefined/blogging.jpg">
weird dude who writes raw HTML</a>.
</p>

<p>Just for the fun of it. <i>:)</i></p>
