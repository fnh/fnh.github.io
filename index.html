<h1>Can you ever know enough about people?</h1>

<p>
I recently finished <i>100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Susan Weinschenk has compiled a lot of research into a hundred short essays.
The book covers a lot of ground with topics ranging from perception, over
how the human memory and thinking and decision making processes work to how
humans tend to deal with error. 
</p>

<p>
The book doesn't require any prior knowledge. It is very digestable and actionable.
The chapters are to the point and contain a condensed list of key takeways. 
No reading order is requiered. Being very broad in topics makes it rather hard to summarize -
yet cheapskates and people in a hurry could probably even get some insights 
out of simply reading once through the table of contents. 
</p>

<p>All in all: a recommended reading.</p>

<h1>It's been a while...</h1>

<p>
Many, many years ago, I maintained a website. It was fun. 
Then life got in the way, domains expired, and that site fell into oblivion. 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile I made a profession out of what was once my hobby.

Earning one's bread doing what one would have gladly pursued free, for passion
is a privilege granted to only a fraction of the human race, as Fred Brooks 
rightfully stated in the epilogue of his seminal <i>Mythical Man-Month</i>.
So, by and large, I consider myself a very lucky man. 
</p>

<p>
Yet, over the years I lost track of the passion, the fun aspect slipped away a bit.
This therefore is an attempt at rekindling it. For now, in the shape of a single
file, filled with random musings of some weird dude who writes raw HTML.
</p>

<p>Just for the fun of it. <i>:)</i></p>
