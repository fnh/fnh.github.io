<h1>It's been a while...</h1>

<p>
Many, many years ago, I maintained a website. It was fun. 
Then life got in the way, domains expired, and that site fell into oblivion. 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile I made a profession out of what was once my hobby.

Earning one's bread doing what one would have gladly pursued free, for passion
is a privilege granted to only a fraction of the human race, as Fred Brooks 
rightfully stated in the epilogue of his seminal <i>Mythical Man-Month</i>.
So, by and large, I consider myself a very lucky man. 
</p>

<p>
Yet, over the years I lost track of the passion, the fun aspect slipped away a bit.
This therefore is an attempt at rekindling it. For now, in the shape of a single
file, filled with random musing of some weird dude who writes raw HTML.
</p>
<p>Just for the fun of it. <i>:)</i></p>
